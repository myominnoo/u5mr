\description{
The Coale-Demeny life tables consist of four sets of models, each representing
a distinct mortality pattern. Each model is arranged in terms of 25 mortality
levels, associated with different expectations of life at birth for females in
such a way that \code{e0} of 20 years corresponds to level 1 and \code{e0} of 80 years
corresponds to level 25.
}
\details{
The four underlying mortality patterns of the Coale-Demeny models are called
"North", "South", "East" and "West". They were identified through statistical
and graphical analysis of a large number of life tables of acceptable quality,
mainly for European countries.
