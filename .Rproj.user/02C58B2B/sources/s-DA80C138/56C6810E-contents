Description: Contains functions for calculating under-five child mortality estimates using the Trussell version of the Brass method (United Nations (1990) <https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/pdf/mortality/stepguide_childmort.pdf> and United Nations (1983) <https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/pdf/mortality/stepguide_childmort.pdf>) as well as applying the cohort-derived methods by Rajaratnam and colleagues (Rajaratnam JK, Tran LN, Lopez AD, Murray CJL (2010) "Measuring Under-Five Mortality: Validation of New Low-Cost Methods" <doi:10.1371/journal.pmed.1000253>).

Description: This is a tool for estimating child mortality. Current implementation includes the Trussell version of the Brass method using the Coale-Demeny model life tables and supporting datasets of coefficients and automatic interpolating values between probabilities of dying at a certain age and model tables.
